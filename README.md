# Flutter Riverpod Tutorial

This Flutter project is a complete tutorial on using Riverpod for state management in Flutter applications. Riverpod is a state management library based on Provider that offers a simple and powerful approach to handling application state.

In this tutorial, we will explore the core concepts of Riverpod and how to use different types of providers available in the library. We will cover the following key topics:

- `Provider`: We will learn how to use the basic `Provider` to provide and consume values in our Flutter application.

- `FutureProvider`: We will discover how to use `FutureProvider` to work with asynchronous operations and load data into our application.

- `StreamProvider`: We will explore how to use `StreamProvider` to handle continuous and reactive data streams.

- `ChangeNotifierProvider`: We will see how to use `ChangeNotifierProvider` to update and notify changes in the application state.

- `StateNotifierProvider`: We will learn how to use `StateNotifierProvider` to manage the mutable state of our application.
